Grapher
=======

Application designed to draw plots of functions and graphically solve differential equations.


1. Installation
----------------

Simply download Grapher.exe and Grapher.exe.manifest and put them in one folder. From now on, 
to open the application, just open the Grapher.exe.

2. Using
--------

After opening, you already have three example functions plotted. To remove them, select them in Functions menu and click
on *Remove*.
To add new functions, click on *Add* in Functions menu. Added functions are defaulted to Constant y=0 function.
To change the formula, select function in Functions menu and use boxes in Function menu to change settings. For example,
if you want to add new function f1=2x^2+3x-4, you have to click *Add*, select the new function, then select Quadratic
from the combo box on the top, and write coefficients 2, 3, -4 into *A*, *B* and *C* fields. Last thing to do is to
apply the settings by pressing *OK*.
You can set the visibility of the function on the graph by selecting it and checking or unchecking the checkbox *Show*.
In the coefficients boxes you can write: real numbers (such as 1, 4.5, -2.3e10), "e" as Euler's number, "pi" as the ratio
of circle's circumference to its diameter, or finally "fi" (for example "f1", "f6"), to make ith function a coefficient.
To change size of graph window you can either: use buttons in bottom right corner, use mouse wheel on graph window, or
manually write the needed size in boxes in bottom and apply settings using *Resize*.
To change position of graph window, you can either: drag window using mouse, use buttons in bottom right corner, or
manually write the position in boxes in bottom and apply settings using *Resize*.

3. Known bugs
-------------

- sometimes the graph window disappears (temporary fix: drag the window)
- differential equations is still blank - not implemented yet

4. Troubleshooting
